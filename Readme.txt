The b16 Compiler is a compiler a wrote for a fictional b16 interpreter 

I wrote this to practice io operations, memory managment, as well as practicing solving complex problems.

In the bin/debug directory you will find a .b16asm file with an example of the b16 language, a .b16 file with the bytecode example output and a .bat file to demonstrate how to pass the files to the .exe
